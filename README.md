Material for the Multimedia Data Processing exam

> [!NOTE]
> All the exercises/assignments/exams have been solved using **Visual Studio 2022**

## What can you find in this repo? 

- Assignments given during the course
- Exercises given during the course
- Past programming exams
- Lectures with notes

> [!TIP]
> All the exercises (except `huffdiff`) and the past programming exams have passed all the tests on [olj](https://olj.ing.unimore.it)
> - `huffdiff` has passed the decompression tests but not the compression tests (it still is a correct solution)

## How can you contribute? 

The solutions have been coded on a test-driven basis (e.g., the code is not "nice", "portable", "optimized" or anything else, it just works)
- If you come up with some brilliant, better or alternative solutions, feel free to add them
- If you notice that some exams, exercises or lectures are missing, feel free to add them
